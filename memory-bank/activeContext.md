# Active Context

*   **Current Focus:** Implementing UI changes based on user feedback.
*   **Recent Changes:**
    *   Initialized Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) and `.clinerules`.
    *   Updated `assets/css/style.css` with a modern gradient background.
    *   Refactored `templates/index.php` to remove tabs and create a single-page layout for creating tokens and tracking results.
    *   Added options to copy the generated tracking link as both a full HTML `<img>` tag and a direct URL.
    *   Added a button ("Download HTML for Outlook") to `templates/index.php` to download a simple HTML file containing the tracking pixel.
    *   Updated `assets/js/script.js` to support the new layout, copy functionality (fixing a syntax error), and added the `downloadHtmlFile` function.
    *   **Fixed JS errors:**
        *   Corrected `copyToClipboard` function to handle non-HTTPS environments by checking for `navigator.clipboard` and falling back to `document.execCommand`.
        *   Corrected the selector for the "Track" button in the `getInfo` function to `#lookup-section .input-group button`.
*   **Next Steps:** Update `progress.md` and attempt completion.
*   **Decisions/Considerations:** Combined token creation and lookup into a single view for simplicity. Added distinct copy buttons and an HTML download button for user convenience. Addressed JS errors reported by the user.
