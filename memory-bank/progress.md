# Progress

*   **What Works:**
    *   Basic file structure exists.
    *   Memory Bank initialized.
    *   Frontend UI (`templates/index.php`, `assets/css/style.css`, `assets/js/script.js`) updated:
        *   Modern gradient background applied.
        *   Single-page layout combining token creation and lookup.
        *   Functionality to generate token and display HTML tag/direct URL.
        *   Copy-to-clipboard buttons for both HTML tag and direct URL (with fallback for non-HTTPS).
        *   Button to download a simple HTML file containing the tracking pixel (`Download HTML for Outlook`).
        *   Basic structure for displaying tracking results.
        *   JavaScript error fixes applied (clipboard fallback, button selector).
*   **What's Left to Build/Verify:**
    *   Database setup (`install.php`) - **Crucial next step.** Needs to be run on the hosting server.
    *   Backend logic for token generation (`api/NewToken` in `index.php`) - Partially exists, needs verification.
    *   Backend logic for tracking pixel request (`/image/` route in `index.php`) - Partially exists, needs verification.
    *   Backend logic for retrieving tracking info (`api/GetInfo` in `index.php`) - Partially exists, needs verification.
    *   Database interaction implementation (`includes/db.php`, `includes/functions.php`).
    *   Configuration setup (`.env.example` to `.env`, `includes/config.php`).
    *   Token history functionality (`api/GetHistory` in `index.php` and JS) - Currently stubbed, needs implementation if desired.
*   **Current Status:** Frontend UI updated based on feedback, including JS error fixes. Core backend functionality and database setup still need implementation/verification **on the hosting server**.
*   **Known Issues:**
    *   Token generation/tracking likely still fails until `install.php` is run on the hosting server.
    *   Clipboard fallback (`document.execCommand`) might not work reliably in all browsers/contexts. HTTPS is recommended.
